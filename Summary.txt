This is a simple web page that features a joystick, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The joystick is made up of two elemen
ts: a circular background with the id joystick, and a smaller circle with the id button, which can be moved around inside the joys
tick element by clicking and dragging it.The CSS code defines the styling for the joystick and button elements. The joystick eleme
nt has a width and height of 100px and is positioned relatively, with a border-radius of 50% to make it a circle. The button eleme
nt has a width and height of 50px, is positioned absolutely in the center of the joystick element using the top, left, and transfo
rm properties, and also has a border-radius of 50% to make it a circle.The JavaScript code defines event listeners for mouse event
s on the joystick and button elements, and handles the logic for moving the button element around inside the joystick element. Whe
n the button is clicked, the handleMouseDown function sets a flag isDragging to true, indicating that the button is being dragged.
 When the mouse is released, the handleMouseUp function sets isDragging to false, and moves the button back to its original positi
on. When the mouse is moved, the handleMouseMove function calculates the new position of the button based on the mouse coordinates
 and the position of the joystick element, and sets the button element's transform property to move it to the new position. If the
 button is moved too far from the center of the joystick, it is constrained to the edge of the joystick element.
